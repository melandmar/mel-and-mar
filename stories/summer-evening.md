It's a warm Sunday in summer. I am wearing a short light black dress with flowers on it and I am on my way over to Mar's place for the evening. I look amazing, gorgeous, cute, stunning and really put some effort into my outfit with some cute earrings, my necklace and nail polish. I think to myself: "I wonder what word Mar will use 😊". At his apartment building I know exactly where to ring. He opens the front door and I walk up the stairs to his apartment. I enter through the ajar door and see him across the entrance hallway. <!--more-->I smile and cutely say "Hey ☺️". Upon seeing me his eyes open wide and he has a big smile. "Wooaahhh 🤩 You l,ook fabulous Mel!!!". I close the door behind me, giggle and smile across my face while walking towards him. We kiss. Our lips drift apart but he still holds me and replies "Hey" with his sexy voice. We slowly let go of each other and I start leaning forwards to untie my shoe laces. Mar goes "Wait! Let me do it!" and quickly drops down to his knees. "Well it seems like I'll be getting the full-on princess treatment today 🥰" I think to myself. While untying the second shoe he looks up at my crotch and then up again at my face grinning. I can't help it but have to giggle again. I take of my shoes, leave my stuff and Mar takes me by my hand to his bed. We both lay down and start talking about how we are feeling and our days. In his arms with him gently stroking my thigh that lays across him I can feel my heartbeat slowing down and all the tension fade away. Eventually he asks if we want to go outside for a walk. "I want to show you off Mel :)".
We put on our shoes and grab a light jacket. On our way to the nearby park we each grab something to drink at the [Späti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tkauf). The sun is getting low but it's still comfortably warm. We hold hands and walk through the park while talking about our upcoming vacation. After some time we get to the parks beach volleyball field and recognize a few friends playing. Mar plays there quite a lot. The atmosphere is amazing and we decide to join them. We greet everyone and Mar asks me and everyone playing if he can join. I nod and a good friend offers his spot: "You can fill my place. I am happy to take a break and spend some time with Mel!". She walks off the field and hugs Mar for a proper hello. Mar takes off his shoes and socks and quickly fills her place so the game can continue. While we hug she tells me how amazing I look. We sit down on the bench next to the field. I am really happy to see her. I offer her something to drink and wait for her to catch her breath again and calm down a bit. We start talking and laughing. Having a conversation and watching the others play volleyball is a lot of fun. Every now and then Mar looks over to me smiling to check on me. Eventually he takes his shirt off and my attention plummets. My friend notices right away and rolls her eyes. "Oh dear... You really can't help it right?". I am a bit embarrassed but we quickly get back to talking. Over the next minutes we get to see the beautiful sunset and the game quickly come to an end when it got too dark. Everyone is getting together and having a good time. It gets a bit cold on my legs and uncomfortable on the park bench and Mar offers me his jacket to sit on which I happily accept. Seeing everyone so happy makes me really happy. I also get a lot more compliments for my dress. Mar seems really proud.  Eventually we say goodbye to everyone and walk home. The park is still full with people enjoying a wonderful summer night. At home we instantly brush our teeth, undress to our underpants and quickly get to bed. We are both pretty exhausted but still cuddle a bit while listening to the sounds coming from the streets through the open windows. His hands on my chest and skin feel amazing as always. I ask him how he is feeling. "Good! I thought the evening with you and the others was super nice. Berlin summer is the best. Everyone is just so cheerful and happy. Also your outfit was a biiig highlight. I hope you felt just as pretty. Thank you!". "I did! And I feel the same way! With you and good friends it's just so easy to make the most of the summer. Oh and next time you'll be the one dressing all fancy and pretty for me and I get to be the one showing off my partner and getting to play volleyball >:) Deal?". "Deal!". We smile and kiss each other good night.
The next day I wake up all ruffled up having slept through the entire night.
