The one thing I just can't imagine about Mel and Mar is how and where they have
met. It might stay in the dark until I finally find a partner. Or I might think
of something in the future.

Mel and Mar live in Berlin (Germany) and usually see each other twice a week.
They text and call each other whenever they feel like it. Usually not every day.
They're busy.
