I am a pansexual trans girl who is really into boys. This collection of short stories (short story cycle) tells the story of a monogamous hetero couple. I am Mel (not my actual name) and I imagine my life with my boyfriend Mar. These short stories let me explore/discover/play with/experience romance and a romantic relationship (including what I look for in a partner), sexuality and sex, different bodies and passing, desire, lust and kinks, different lives with work and homes and much more. I have autism which is relevant for some stories. Mel and Mar live in Berlin. Even though these stories are written in English some concepts might only really make sense to Europeans or people from Berlin. Stories are tagged [NSFW](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NSFW) or [SFW](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=SFW). Note that even stories with the SFW tag can include descriptions of nudity and sexual intent, just not descriptions of sex/sexual acts. It's not so easy to determine what is and isn't NSFW. There are stories from the first few months of the relationship tagged "Early in the relationship" (the past), stories from a few years in tagged "Maturing stage of the relationship" (the present) and stories from many years in tagged "Far into the relationship" (the future). Even though I imagine them to be the past, present or future all of them are written in the present tense.

I want to stay anonymous. If you somehow find out my identity please keep it to yourself.

# Backstory

Dating men as a non-passing trans woman sucks! Since finding a partner has
proven so difficult for me I started compensating with my imagination and spend
many mornings in bed just imagining a world where I had a boyfriend and spending
time with him. I am playing through social situations with a lot of experienced
realism which is something I have been doing to plan out social situations for a
long time. I basically have 3D models of people I know in my head so I can plan
out scenes in advance. This skill is probably a way to deal with autistic social
limitations. Then I figured I could also write them down as a creative outlet in
my very sciency life and share them with the world. They might entertain some
people. I mean [smut](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=smut) is
just fun. And why should I [yearn](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yearn) by myself if we can all yearn together >:) So enjoy reading, analyzing, masturbating to, extending, re-reading these stories!
